```

### Administration:
```bash
pvw collections get-admins             # Get collection administrators

pvw collections remove-admin           # Remove collection administrator
```

### Advanced Operations:
```bash
pvw collections get-statistics         # Collection usage statistics
pvw collections get-permissions        # Get collection permissions
pvw collections set-permissions        # Set collection permissions
pvw collections bulk-operations        # Bulk collection operations
pvw collections export                 # Export collections configuration
pvw collections import                 # Import collections configuration
pvw collections validate-hierarchy     # Validate collection structure
```

## 📈 **Enhanced Business Metadata Capabilities**

### Advanced Operations Added:
```bash
pvw entity bulk-update-business-metadata      # Bulk update across multiple entities
pvw entity export-business-metadata           # Export business metadata to CSV
pvw entity validate-business-metadata         # Validate metadata template
pvw entity get-business-metadata-status       # Get import operation status  
pvw entity search-business-metadata           # Search by business metadata
pvw entity get-business-metadata-statistics   # Usage statistics and insights
```

### Enhanced Features:
- ✅ **Bulk Operations:** Process multiple entities simultaneously
- ✅ **Export Functionality:** Extract business metadata to CSV format
